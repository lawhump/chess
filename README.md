# Chess
## A take on the classic intellectual duel

This was written for my Programming Studio class, where the emphasis is how to
become a better programmer. As such, they stressed writing unit-tests, writing
readable, maintainable, modular code, etc. Hopefully some of those practices
will shine through.

### How to execute
I used IntelliJ's IDEA to build and execute this. You want to run
src/com/lhumphr2/chess/view/Main.java

### TODO
 * I know that my GUI was not reflecting piece capture last I checked. I should
   have the code for when it last was in Subversion though, although I have a
   hunch as to where it broke and how to fix it.

 * Checkmate not implemented.

 * Current custom pieces not 'playable'. That and add logic for the ones that
   I'm thinking of.

 * Scoring

#### For anyone who has yet to take the class
Please don't copy that'd just be a pain for you and me. Ty <3
